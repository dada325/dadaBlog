Deep learning has been the trend in last 6 or 7 years, I still remember that the first time I saw it on ETH curriculum, and I was at that time don't even know what is machine learning. I just chose in the coming semester the courses Machine lenarnig, and advance machine learning, and then probablstic machine learning. I still rembember the Prof.Joachim, Prof.Kause. Prof.Kause becom then the president of the AI centre of ETH, if My memory is correct.

Since then i am very interested in data science, took part in some of the data science competitions on kaggle, and also be in the data science community of ETH then. But I am always having some doubt of how far will Machine leanring will take us, many of the competitions on kaggle are very clear defined, I didn't finish it well, however, my problem may be i am not that focus on a certain problem.

Not until that I find that the real question , or the goal of all of these is AI for science. This kind of thoughs always driven me into the direction of tring to seek some new way to approch artificial intelligence, but not just deep learning, which make me again, try to pursue to apply new mathematical models to think about the model, the problem and the data, and the paradim of the existing way of construction a model. I think this may be my ultimate goal of my research. Not just doing machine learning, deep learning. Now, I am still learning a lot of Math, all kind of different subjects, and always i try to comprehend the new concept into my solution space and knowlegde network, try to weave a bigger net to make a new model, new paradim of constructing the space which connect different kind of problem, elevate the problem to a higher dimension.

Anyway, I am not a Math major, But the math draw me into a bigger map of pursuing the truth of the world. I am so glad that this happen not latter in my life, for i found that it is a very long road and it may take all my life.
